# Take in what tak.gov sends back, file it, and read the scans before anyone publishes.
#
# tak.gov returns one zip per build: the signed APK and AAB, a Fortify static
# analysis, an OWASP Dependency-Check report, an SBOM, and the build log. Until
# 2026-09-12 that arrived as a pile of identically named files that had to be
# sorted by hand, and the scans were read only if somebody remembered to. The
# operator: "you need some sort of skill or something or rule to like check all
# this shit to make sure we dont have any issues that we want to correct before
# we publish."
#
# So: drop every return zip in $ATAK_DIST/inbox and run this. It reads the plugin,
# the version and the ATAK target off the APK name inside, files everything where
# it belongs, and then checks the things that decide whether a build is fit to
# publish. It is a gate, not a report: a real finding exits non-zero.
#
#   ./scripts/takgov-intake.sh              # everything in the inbox
#   ./scripts/takgov-intake.sh <zip>...     # named zips
#   ./scripts/takgov-intake.sh --keep       # leave the zips in the inbox
#
# What it files:
#   $ATAK_DIST/signed/<apk>, <aab>
#   $ATAK_DIST/scans/<Plugin>/<version>/<target>/{build.log,fortify_*,dependency-check-report.html,sbom/,...}
#
# What it checks, and why each one is here:
#   signer          a build signed by anything but the TAK Product Center is not
#                   the artifact we asked for
#   versionCode     (MAJOR*10000+MINOR*100+PATCH)*10000 + ATAK major*1000+minor*10
#                   +patch, one code per target, or no MDM can push it as an
#                   update -- the same rule submission-zip.sh enforces going out
#   version match   the APK inside says the version its name claims
#   package         the same package id as the last signed release, or it installs
#                   alongside the old one instead of over it
#   certificate     the same signing certificate as the last signed release, for
#                   the same reason
#   Fortify         "Rendering N results": any N above zero is a real finding in
#                   our own source and stops the gate, unless the operator has
#                   accepted that exact finding (plugin, category and file) in
#                   ../atak-plugins-notes/fortify-accepted.txt, each line naming
#                   the record of the decision; those print as ACCEPTED
#   Dependency-Check  every CVE is listed with the artifact it attached to. These
#                   are frequently false positives -- the scanner opens an Android
#                   asset renamed to .jar and fuzzy-matches it against a library
#                   -- so the SBOM is checked for the named product before the
#                   gate fails on it
